                <p>When someone asks you who your hero is, names such as Ghandi, Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, and
                        Richard Branson often come to mind. These people have shown acts of courage, valour, and
                        boldness, they are daring and bold.</p>

                <h2>My hero is my Dad, Joe Vitacca.</h2>

                <img src= "Assets/Blog Images - My Hero/thinkingaboutlifting.jpg"   alt= "Joe Vitacca thinking about how he will lift the weights ">

                <p>Joe was a successful weightlifter as a young adult, who had the potential and opportunity to compete
                        in the World Championships, however during this time unrealistic standards had been set due to
                        competitors doping. Not wanting to compete against unrealistic expectations, he chose to retire
                        from his weightlifting career and instead focused on getting a ‘gold’ medal in parenting.</p>
                <p>He often spoke proudly of his success as a weightlifter, the reasons behind retiring, pulling out
                        trophies and photos that had collected dust.
                </p>

                <p>In a world where people too often give up on their dreams, at the age of 60 challenged the norms and
                        decided to go back to competitive weightlifting.</p>

                <img src= "Assets/Blog Images - My Hero/preppingtolift.jpg"  alt="Joe Vitacca prepping to lift weights">

                <p>Instead of getting a trainer, and building up his strength only a few months until his first
                        competition, Joe threw himself he threw himself in head first, he trained everyday, either
                        before or after work, waking up early on weekends.
                </p>

                <p>Dad has shown me that despite all the adversity and challenges it is never too late to follow your
                        dreams, and that you can achieve anything you put your mind to.</p>

                        <p>Dad has now won multiple weightlifting competitions and hopes to compete in the Weightlifting Masters
                        Oceanic & Commonwealth Games in June.

                </p>

                <p>For my lifestyle shoot I chose to capture Dad in his element as he trained for his next competition.
                        These photos were taken on a Cannon 5D Mark II, using a 90mm -300mm L lens and a Canon EOS 70D
                        using a 18–55mm Lens.</p>

                <p>I wanted to capture him in action as he trained, To do this I used a fast shutter speed to eliminate
                        motion, and capture him in ‘action’. I kept the shot focused and sharp by keeping the aperture
                        wide.
                </p>

                <p>As the shutter speeds was fast, it was important to understand how it was affecting my exposure.
                        Since the actual shutter is only open for a brief duration, it does not allow much light to
                        reach the sensor.</p>

                <p>By raising the ISO along with a wider aperture like it compensated this to give seemingly pause life
                        action shot.</p>

                <p>During this shoot some hurdles that I faced was being able to capture Joe in action, while also
                        cautious I was in a busy Crossfit gym and there were other people lifting weights behind and
                        either side of me. There was also large doors open letting in natural light which created alot
                        of shadows and variances in the different shots as we progressed throughout the shoot.</p>

                <p>In post production I wanted to keep the photos authentic and raw, only a few touchups were made which
                        included adjusting the contrast and vibrance of the images to ensure they all had the same feel,
                        as well as touching up a few marks on the wall and floors to maintain the focus of the shoot on
                        Joe.</p>

                <p> The biggest challenge I faced in this lifestyle shoot was trying to choose the images to showcase
                        how proud and inspired I am by my Dad.
                </p>
              
                <p>Thank you Dad for being such a influential figure in my life. </p>
